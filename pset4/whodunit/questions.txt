1.  stdint.h is a header file which provides a set of typedefs that specify exact width integer type
    including the minimum and maximum allowable values for each type.

2.  We use these types to designate signed/unsigned intger type of specific width
    in two's complement representation. example: int32_t designates signed integer type of width 32 bits.

3.  BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
    DWORD = 32 bits = 4 bytes
    LONG = 32 bits = 4 bytes
    WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes

4.  The first 2 bytes of a BMP file are the charecters 'B' and 'M' stored in their ASCII representation.

5.  bfSize is the size of the file as a whole including the headers.
    biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure. Its value is 40 bytes and is constant.

6.  If biHeight is of negative value, it means the bitmap is a topdown DIB with the file origin at the
    upper left.

7.  biBitCount field keeps a count of the bits per pixel. Higher the value of biBitCount higher the
    color depth.

8.  fopen() might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 if the infile/outfile do not exist.

9.  The third parameter of the fread() function is the number of elements of the given size are to be read.
    here the value is 1 because we want to read only one block of element of the corresponding size.

10. If bi.biwidth=3, copy.c assigns the value 3 to padding.

11. fseek() function is used to move the file pointer to a new given location. It takes 3 parameters.

12. SEEK_CUR allows to set the file position indication to the current position and seek of the given number
    bytes is done.
